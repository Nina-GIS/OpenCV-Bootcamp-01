# OpenCV University Bootcamp 01
## Python and OpenCV

This repository contains a curated set of Python scripts from the **OpenCV Bootcamp Open Course**.  
The materials were originally available as **Google Colab** notebooks and have been organized in this Repository as script copies for quick reference and hands-on experimentation in local Python environments.

## About

These scripts demonstrate foundational Computer Vision techniques using OpenCV, including:

- Image loading and manipulation  
- Drawing on images and annotations
- Image enhancement
- Video capture and processing  
- Image alignment  
- Panorama stitching  
- HDR creation  
- Object tracking
- Face detection
- Object detection
- Pose estimation

The content in this Repository is **Not Original**, and belongs to the public course resources to provide a consolidated, offline-friendly version for learning and experimentation.

## Structure

Each script is self-contained and typically corresponds to a key topic or lesson in the Open CV Bootcamp:

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- OpenCV (opencv-python)

### Installation

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

Some scripts (e.g., camera or video capture) may require a webcam or video file input.
